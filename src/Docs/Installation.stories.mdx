# Installing the Library

In order to use the component library in your react project, install with the following command.

`npm install --save our-graph-component-library`

After it has been installed, you can use the components in your code by importing them like any other react component.

```js
import { BarGraph, BarGraphProps } from './BarGraph';

...

<BarGraph
  entries={[
    {
      label: 'Entry One',
      value: 1
    },
    {
      label: 'Entry Two',
      value: 4
    }
  ]}
  xLabel="X AXIS"
  yLabel="Y AXIS"
/>
```

<!-- The usage of this "Component" is intentional to enable react-syntax-highlighter's own highlighter -->

export const Component = () => {
  return <SyntaxHighlighter />;
};
